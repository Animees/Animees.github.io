![Me!](/assets/img/about-me/side-profile-flower.jpg){: w="160" h="160" .right .shadow} 

I am a sociable and versatile person who enjoys taking on new challenges and developing broadly. In my spare time, I am active in scouting, where I have built up both social skills and organisational qualities. I also practice HEMA (historical European swordsmanship) and play bass guitar.

On the work front, I am currently gaining work experience as a peer coach for first-year Computer Science students, where I support the new students with subjects and other problems. During college, I worked in project groups on both hardware and software designs, which gave me a broad technical base. Despite this experience, I am always willing to learn and develop myself further, both professionally and personally.
