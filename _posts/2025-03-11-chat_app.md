## Overview
Iâ€™ve built a **secure chat application** that utilizes **MQTT over WebSockets** for real-time communication. The backend consists of an **Apache web server** serving the frontend, while **Mosquitto MQTT broker** handles message distribution. The main focus of this project was implementing **encryption and authentication** for secure communication.

## Features
- **MQTT via WebSockets** â€“ Enables real-time messaging over the web.
- **Apache Web Server** â€“ Hosts the chat application's frontend.
- **HTTPS (Self-Signed Certificates)** â€“ Encrypts communication between clients and the web server.
- **MQTT Security** â€“ Implemented either **TLS encryption** (if supported) or **username/password authentication** for broker access.

## Planned Expansion(s)
- **User Management** â€“ Implement a database for persistent user accounts and authentication.
- **Message History** â€“ Store chat logs for reference.
- **UI Enhancements** â€“ Improve frontend with better design and usability.

## Tech Stack
- **Mosquitto MQTT Broker** for message handling
- **Apache Web Server** for serving the chat interface
- **WebSockets** for real-time messaging
- **TLS/SSL (Self-Signed Certificates)** for encrypted communication
- **HTML, JavaScript** for the frontend

## Next Steps
ðŸ”§ Implement user authentication with a database <br>
ðŸ”§ Add message history persistence
