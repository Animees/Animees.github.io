## Overview
I'm working on a **64x64 LED matrix** that will display the currently playing song from my Spotify account. The project will be powered by an **ESP32**, which will handle API requests to extract song details and display the song's album cover on the matrix.

## Features
- **WiFi Connectivity** â€“ The ESP32 will connect to the internet via WiFi.
- **WiFi Manager** â€“ A custom WiFi manager will allow easy network setup.
- **Web Server for OAuth** â€“ Since Spotify requires authentication, a small web server will run on the ESP32 for OAuth authentication.
- **HTTP Requests & JSON Parsing** â€“ The ESP32 will fetch song data and extract relevant details to display on the matrix.
- **LED Matrix** - Matrix that displays the song's cover with 64x64 resolution.

## Planned Expansion(s)
- **Mobile/Web App** â€“ An interface to configure:
   - LED matrix settings (brightness, colors, etc.)
   - Spotify account linking
   - WiFi configuration
- **Encasing** - An encasing for production and aesthetics

## Tech Stack
- **ESP32** for processing
- **64x64 LED Matrix** for displaying the song's cover art
- **Spotify API** for fetching song data
- **Webserver (ESPAsyncWebServer)** for OAuth handling
- **VSCODE / PlatformIO** for development

## Next Steps
ðŸ”§ Set up WiFi manager <br>
ðŸ”§ Start implementing Matrix functionality
